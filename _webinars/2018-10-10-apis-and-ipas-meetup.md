In addition to webinars, the AvaTax API team will be presenting in-person at live events during October.

Ted will give an in-depth presentation on how he and the AvaTax API Team created the documentation for Avalara’s sales tax API at [joint meetup organized by Seattle APIs & IPAs and Seattle Write the Docs](https://www.meetup.com/seattle-api/events/254623048/?rv=ea1_v2&_xtd=gatlbWFpbF9jbGlja9oAJDVkZTdhZGNiLWMzOTctNDA1Ni04MDE5LThhNGY4OWY5OTE3Mg). The meetup takes place from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. PT on Oct. 10 at the Best Buy Technology Development Center located at 1000 Denny Way, 8th Floor in Seattle.

We’re excited to be participating in these two events and grateful to the event organizers for giving us a chance to share our experience building our API with the broader developer community.

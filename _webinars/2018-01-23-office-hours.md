Calling all developers trying to build tax compliance solutions! Are you interested in how Avalara tracks tax information across different types of products?

Join us for the next installment of our new weekly webinar series, Office Hours with AvaTax, to talk with Ron Paul, a manager on Avalara's Content Team!

We'll spend the first 15 minutes talking about how the AvaTax API allows you to access Avalara's database of product tax codes to look up information calculate differing tax rates for differing jurisdictions. The last 15 minutes will be an open Q&A so you can ask our team of expert engineers questions about any aspect of the AvaTax platform, whether its the AvaTax API, our SDKs or our documentation.

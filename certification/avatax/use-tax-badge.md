        <h5>Enable Logging - <em>Required</em></h5>
            <p class="badgerequirement">The user must have an option to enable detailed AvaTax transaction logging within the application, including capture of round-trip processing time. Users should have a means to download these detailed log files.</p>

                    <li>When NOT self assessing, do not commit transaction to the Admin Console</li>
                </ul>
            In the case of Global Use Tax assessment, commit all transactions regardless of the vendor.
            </p>

(See UPC requirements in the Administration & Utilities Integration section) For Purchase Invoices not associated with a Purchase Order, you may not have access to the ItemCode from the client application. In that case, simply use the GL account number/cost center identifier.</p>
            
        <h5>Item Description   - <em>Required</em></h5>
            <p class="badgerequirement">Identify item/service/charge description to pass to the AvaTax service with a human-readable description or item name.</p>

            <p class="badgerequirement">When the Product Master provides functionality to group items/products in the product catalog. Associate an Avalara Tax Code to an item group/product group/commodity code. The Tax Code assignment becomes the default for all items/products in the group.

If the user elects to use AvaTax UPC, Ensure that the appropriate field containing UPC data is mapped to the ItemCode parameter formatted as: <code>&lt;UPC:&gt;+&lt;UPC Data&gt;</code>. Example: <code>UPC:1234567890000</code>. By formatting the value with <code>UPC:</code> identifier, our engine can pick up the UPC code, and the user can avoid mapping a tax code for that item. If no UPC data is available still default to the regular ItemCode mapping.</p>
            <p><small>NOTE:  The UPC functionality is a premium upgrade to the Avalara AvaTax subscription providing taxability decision (taxable vs. non-taxable) without requiring an Avalara Tax Code assignment.</small></p>

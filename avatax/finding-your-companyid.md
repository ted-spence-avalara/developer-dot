<h2>Finding Your CompanyId</h2>
Some AvaTax APIs (notably <a href="/api-reference/avatax/batch/soap/">BatchSvc</a>) require the use of a CompanyId to refer to a particular company. This is similar to CompanyCode in the TaxSvc API, but is a unique identifier within the Avalara database.

The easiest way to locate your CompanyId is through the Admin Console.

<div class="caption">
    <img src="/public/images/blog/company-id-624x308.jpg" alt="Log in to the Admin Console, and click on the company name to edit the profile. The CompanyId will appear in the page URL." />
    Log in to the Admin Console, and click on the company name to edit the profile. The CompanyId will appear in the page URL.

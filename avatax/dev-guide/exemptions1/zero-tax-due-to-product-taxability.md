Transactions can also have zero tax if they involve products that are not taxable.  Some jurisdictions may choose not to tax certain products, or to tax them only in certain conditions.  The jurisdiction may choose to call the product "exempt from tax", or "nontaxable", or simply a product with a zero tax rate.  AvaTax will determine the taxability of the product based on the <u><b class="dev-guide-bold">TaxCode</u></b> you provide.


Product taxability and TaxCodes are discussed in more detail in <a class="dev-guide-link" href="/avatax/dev-guide/product-taxability/">Chapter 5 - Product Taxability</a>.

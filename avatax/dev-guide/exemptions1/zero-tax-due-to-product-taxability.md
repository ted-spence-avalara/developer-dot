Another common reason why tax could be zero would be related to product taxability.  A transaction may have zero tax because the products sold in the transaction are exempt from tax, or nontaxable, or have a zero rate, in the jurisdictions involved in that transaction.


Product taxability is discussed in more detail in <a href="/avatax/dev-guide/product-taxability/">Chapter 5 - Product Taxability</a>.

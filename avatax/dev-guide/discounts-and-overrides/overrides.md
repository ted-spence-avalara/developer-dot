There are two types of overrides supported in AvaTax: <code>TaxAmount</code> and <code>TaxDate</code>. The <code>TaxAmount Override</code>, will do just that, override the tax amount on the transaction. This is particularly helpful if you need to record transactions to AvaTax which had the tax calculated in another system. The <code>TaxDate</code> override, allows you to specify what tax date to use in the calculation. By default, the AvaTax engine will use the document date as the <code>TaxDate</code>. The common use-case for this override is processing refunds, as you want to calculate the refund tax credit using the same information that the original sale used. Let's take a closer look at each method. 

<h3>Overriding the Tax Amount</h3>
A tax amount override is when you override the tax amount of a transaction rather than having AvaTax calculate it.

This feature is available so that you can import transactions where you've already calculated the tax amount prior to using AvaTax.  An example would be when you are importing data from an older system so that you can keep all your data in AvaTax.  Other customers may choose to use this feature to import data from partner sales - for example, if you were selling via a merchant platform and you want to import your data into AvaTax.

Tax amount overrides can also be used to determine the difference between tax paid to a vendor and consumer use tax due to an authority.  This is covered in more detail in CHAPTER.

<h3>Overriding the Tax Date</h3>
<code>TaxDate</code> overrides are used when you want to calculate tax on a date different than the date of a document.  For example, if you are returning a product, the tax date of the transaction would be the date of the original transaction, rather than the date of the refund.

Let's say Alice purchases a new chair from the store on May 1st.  She discovers that the chair doesn't fit in her home office, and she decides to return the chair on June 1st.  If you calculate tax on the June 1st date, you might refund a different amount of tax to Alice than she paid on May 1st.  So you use a <code>TaxDate</code> override to ensure that the tax rates are calculated as of May 1st.

<h3>Certification Requirements</h3>
To have your integration certified AvaTax for Refunds/Credit Memos, you will need to demonstrate credit memo transactions pass the original transaction sale date as the <code>TaxOverride</code>/<code>TaxDate</code>. You may also use <a class="dev-guide-link" href="https://developer.avalara.com/api-reference/avatax/rest/v2/methods/Transactions/RefundTransaction/">RefundTransaction API</a>, which automates much of this process.

<h3>Line Level Overrides</h3>

The examples we have used so far have all shown the <code>TaxAmount</code>/<code>TaxDate</code> overrides at the document level. It is also important to note that these overrides can also be applied at the line level.

<h3>Consumer Use Tax Overrides</h3>

The Tax Override function is also used for verification of merchant charged tax in a Use Tax scenario. This will be explained in more detail in <a class="dev-guide-link" href="/avatax/dev-guide/consumer-use-tax/">Chapter 10: Consumer Use Tax</a>.

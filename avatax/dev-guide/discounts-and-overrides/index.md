In this chapter, we'll explain how to use Overrides and Discounts in AvaTax.  
<ul class="dev-guide-list">
  <li>An override is used when your transaction overrides normal behavior of the AvaTax engine.  It can be used to change the tax amount or tax date for a transaction.</li>
  <li>Discount is a reduction of the price on your item/service. There are several ways you can handle a discount with the AvaTax engine.</li>
</ul>
By the end of this chapter, you will be familiar with how to process both TaxAmount and TaxDate overrides as well as understand the various methods used to handle discounts.

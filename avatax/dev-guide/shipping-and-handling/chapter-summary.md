In this chapter you've learned how to account for shipping and handling charges, as well the implication they can have on tax determinations depending on the jurisdictions you're shipping to and from. 

We recommend that a connector provide the following functionality:
<ul class="dev-guide-list">
  <li>If you have a native built in function for shipping or freight charges for the user interface to allow for that section of the platform to show a taxcode box where a customer can input any of our shipping taxcodes.</li>
  <li>If your platform doesn't have a native built in function for shipping and the customer is instructed to simply add shipping as a separate charge or line of the order they should be able to create a misc charge item or freight item within their inventory/services management and map it to a shipping tax code so that can select the appropriate shipping method when invoicing their clients.</li>
</ul>

Optionally, you can include additional features if you choose:
<ul class="dev-guide-list">
  <li>Use the <a class="dev-guide-link" href="https://rest.avatax.com/swagger/ui/index.html#!/Definitions/ListTaxCodes">GET Taxcode Definitions</a> method of the API in order to build a search of our tax codes within the application, so that the customer can search by keyword within the application for the appropriate shipping taxcode without having to exit the application itself.</li>
</ul>

<div class="dev-guide-certification">
<div class="dev-guide-certification-heading">Certification Requirements</div>
<div class="dev-guide-certification-content">
AvaTax Certified Connectors must demonstrate that you can apply an AvaTax Goods and Service code to the freight/handling charge.

Additionally, you must demonstrate that the freight/handling charge is a separate line on the transaction sent to AvaTax
</div>
</div>


Tests you can use to verify that your connector is working correctly:
<ul class="dev-guide-list">
    <li><a class="dev-guide-link" href="/avatax/dev-guide/shipping-and-handling/taxability-of-shipping-charges/#test1">7.1.1 - Taxability of Shipping Charges</a></li>
    <li><a class="dev-guide-link" href="/avatax/dev-guide/shipping-and-handling/taxability-of-shipping-charges/#test2">7.1.2 - Taxability of Shipping Charges</a></li>
    <li><a class="dev-guide-link" href="/avatax/dev-guide/shipping-and-handling/taxability-of-shipping-charges/#test3">7.1.3 - Taxability of Shipping Charges</a></li>
    <li><a class="dev-guide-link" href="/avatax/dev-guide/shipping-and-handling/taxability-of-handling-charges/#test1">7.2.1 - Taxability of Handling Charges</a></li>
</ul>

These optional features are available but are not required for certified connectors.

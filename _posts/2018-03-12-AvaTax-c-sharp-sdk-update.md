Avalara was advised of an issue affecting some users of the AvaTax C# SDK. In some environments, the C# SDK submitted HTTP verbs in lowercase, which is not always permitted by firewall and router rules.  Avalara is publishing a revision of the [C# SDK 18.2.1.168](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Avalara.AvaTax/18.2.1.168) to correct this issue.  We advise all customers using the C# SDK to upgrade to the latest revision.

<h2>Does This Affect Me?</h2>
Customers known to be affected are running the combination of:
<ol>
    <li>Visual Studio 2017</li> 
    <li>on Mac OS X</li>
    <li>with AvaTax C# SDK 18.2.0.167 or earlier</li>
</ol>

Our testing team has evaluated this issue, and will continue to test in a variety of environments and C# versions.  As of this date we are not aware of any other versions that are affected. Whether or not you are affected by this issue, we encourage you to periodically update your NuGet reference and download the latest revision of AvaTax from [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Avalara.AvaTax/18.2.1.168).

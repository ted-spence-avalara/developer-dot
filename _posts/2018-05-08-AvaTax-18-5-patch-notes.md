<h3>Weekly Office Hours Webinar</h3>

The AvaTax API team hosts a [weekly developer webinar](https://developer.avalara.com/resources/webinars/) where you can meet and talk to the developers directly.  If you would like to ask questions about this release, please sign up and join us for a lively discussion of the AvaTax API.

<h3>Sandbox Testing Window</h3>

The AvaTax release schedule includes a preview period where the latest software is available for integration testing in the [AvaTax Sandbox Environment](https://sandbox-rest.avatax.com) two weeks before launching to production. If your engineering team would like a sandbox account for integration testing purposes, please contact your account manager or [open a support ticket](https://help.avalara.com/Directory/Contact_Avalara/Submit_a_Case).

<h3>TaxContent API Improvements</h3>

The TaxContent API suite now supports using custom tax code values.  To use custom tax codes, you must create items within your company tied to those custom tax codes.

Documentation for the TaxContent API suite has been extended to clarify timeout behavior.  The TaxContent API may take a number of minutes to calculate tax for all the scenarios specified in the combination of locations and tax codes.  Please note that long running API calls may cause routers or other network connections to drop.

If you experience any difficulties using the tax content APIs, please consider reducing the size of your API call and making separate calls for each location.

<h3>Customers and Certificates API</h3>

Due to problems handling certificates that are not yet assigned to a country or region, we are updating the `required` flag for the `country` and `region` fields on [CertificateModel](/api-reference/avatax/rest/v2/models/CertificateModel/) and [CustomerModel](/api-reference/avatax/rest/v2/models/CustomerModel/).  The `country` and `region` fields are now required in all cases.

Updated the default certificate object to include the exemption reason `RESALE`, which represents the most common use case for exemption certificates.

<h3>Invoice Messages in Transactions</h3>

The [CreateTransaction API](/api-reference/avatax/rest/v2/methods/Transactions/CreateTransaction/) now includes data elements provided for the convenience of European VAT calculations.  Many EU countries require invoice messaging indicating VAT compliance.  These new message objects permit you to use the exact EU terminology for messaging for VAT tax.

<h3>Advanced Rules Improvements</h3>

New API introduced to allow customers to enable and disable their advanced rules.
